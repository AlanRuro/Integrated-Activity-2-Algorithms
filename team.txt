Specific parts of the project we worked on:
- Gerardo: MST implementation using Kruskal's algorithm, implementation of BFS search in Edmons Karp's algorithm, 
and we both worked on the structure of the project and the report. 
- Alan: TSP implementation using the nearest neighbor algorithm, Edmons Karp's algorithm implementation and voronoi
diagram implementation.

We both worked on every part of the project, but in general we can resume it as the parts mentioned above.
